# Introducing the Open Manufacturing Model

Manufacturing is becoming increasingly complex. Modern factories increasingly combine traditional equipment with advanced robotics, skilled workers, automated systems, and physical processes with digital control. This complexity creates new challenges in how we organize and manage manufacturing operations.

*A friendly greeting from the Open Manufacturing Model!*

## What is the Open Manufacturing Model?

The Open Manufacturing Model (OMM) is a new framework that helps organize and manage modern manufacturing systems. Think of it as a universal language that helps describe how manufacturing facilities work - from the smallest workshop to the largest factory.

## How Does OMM Work?

OMM breaks down manufacturing into clear, understandable components that mirror real-world operations:

- **Resources** - The equipment and tools that do the actual work
- **Workers** - The people who operate the equipment and perform tasks
- **Products** - What's being manufactured
- **Parts** - The materials and components used to make products
- **Actions** - The specific steps needed in manufacturing
- **Locations** - Where everything happens in the facility

These components work together just like they do in a real factory. For example, when a customer orders a product, OMM helps track everything needed to make it: which machines to use, which workers should operate them, what materials are needed, and where each step should happen.

## Why Does OMM Matter?

As manufacturing becomes more digital, we need better ways to represent manufacturing operations in software systems. OMM helps by:

- Making it easier to plan and track production
- Helping different software systems work together
- Supporting automation and optimization
- Improving quality control
- Making manufacturing more efficient

## Real-World Applications

OMM can be used to:
- Create digital twins of manufacturing facilities
- Improve production planning
- Optimize resource use
- Increase production traceability
- Monitor manufacturing operations

## Development and Support

The Open Manufacturing Model is being developed by [dr. ir. Berry Gerrits](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/berry-gerrits) as part of the [NXTGEN Hightech](https://nxtgenhightech.nl/) Growth Fund, financed by the Dutch Government. More specifically, the Open Manufacturing Model is the result of activities carried out in the **Smart Industry 02 Autonomous Factory - Industrieel Cluster Oost**, also known as **Factory2030**.

How could OMM help improve your manufacturing operations? We'd love to hear your thoughts and questions. [Feel free to send me an email](mailto:b.gerrits@distribute.company).

## Learn More

Whether you're running a small workshop or a large factory, OMM can help make your manufacturing operations more efficient and easier to manage. To learn more about OMM, visit our [documentation](/docs/Introduction).

We welcome feedback and contributions from the manufacturing community as we continue to develop and improve OMM. Together, we can make manufacturing more efficient, more sustainable, and ready for the future.
