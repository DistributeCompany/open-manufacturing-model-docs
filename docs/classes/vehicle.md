# Vehicle

A class to represent a Vehicle.

Vehicles are specialized Resources used for material transport and logistics operations.
They represent mobile equipment such as automated guided vehicles (AGVs), forklifts,
manual transport vehicles, or any other mobile equipment used for moving parts and products.
The Vehicle class extends the Resource class to include vehicle-specific capabilities
and parameters for movement, energy management, and load handling.

Vehicles are connected to various components in the manufacturing system:
- Routes they can traverse
- Locations they move between
- Products or Parts they can transport
- Actions they should perform
- Sensors monitoring their status
- Workers authorized to operate them

**Best Practices**:
- Monitor battery levels and charging status
- Track vehicle location in real-time
- Maintain load capacity constraints
- Schedule preventive maintenance
- Monitor environmental impact
- Optimize route selection
- Ensure safety compliance
